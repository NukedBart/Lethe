For tomorrow:

SO INVITES:
These have limited uses - you "use" an invite through the PATCH api/:server_id/invites/:id route - you FIND the invite by the URL though
You create them - only info needed is num_uses - get server from params, url is autogenerated
The index is a list of invites by servers



ServerIndex:
It's the thing at the side when you log in! It's really cool
Will need to use ActiveStorage for ICONS
Also User Icons

UpdateServerFormContainer
ServerForm

These want to grab server API utils for updating, you know the drill.
CONTROL DAT FORM

Access Serverform with...
ServerMenuContainer
ServerMenu
WITH LINKS TO
ServerSettingsContainer
NotificationSettings(dummy link)
PrivacySettings (dummy link)
ChangeNickname (Actual Link - also you're going to want to add a thing to Membership that stores that info - SO I GUESS IT'S REFACTOR TIME)
HideMutedChannels(dummy link)
Leave Server (TIME FOR DELETE MEMBERSHIP)

Now ServerSettings has Links to
Overview (ServerForm)
Roles (dummy link)
Emoji (dummy link)
Members (HALF WORKING LINK)
-Obviously roles don't exist, but this will have MemberSearch, a fake "display role dropdown", and a COUNT of the members

Don't forget EscapeButton (Modality I think)


FOR NOW: Channel is a fake container
UserStatus will be fake too but have dead links to various Status buttons

UserSettings WILL BE REAL
UserMenu will have links to:
My Account: My Account Form 
renders Username, email, EDIT BUTTON (updateUser)
Fake Two-Factor-Auth button
PrivacyAndSafety(dummy link)
AuthorizedApps (dummy link)
Connections (dummy link)
Billing (dummy link)

Discord Nitro - Will be /sorta/ real, but the payment buttons will have fake info, and the component popup will be a thing that goes to nitroll
HypeSquad (dummy link)

Voice and Video (dummy link)
Notifications (dummy link)
Text and Images (dummy link)
Appearance (dummy link)
Streamer Mode (dummy link)

UserInfo! component
Which has 
UserIcon

Roles (fake roles)
Note

Message (text box, does nothing except return "This user is not available.  AND NEVER WILL BE)

RIGHTCLICKS (OH NO)
UserRightClickMenuContainer
UserRightClickMenu
Links to:
UserProfile: Component with UserIcon, Username+id, SendMessage(dummy button), ... menu with dummy friend button, dummy block button, dummy message button
UserInfo gives dummy notes, dummy Connections
